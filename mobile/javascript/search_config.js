WRITING PART 6                   • There are 5 questions and an example.            • Each question is a sentence which gives a description of a word.            • You must write the word, spelling it correctly. The first letter of the word is always given.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   23","2.3.2. WRITING PART 6 (cont.)                   Exam advice            • Read each sentence carefully.            • Count the number of spaces to find out how many letters the word has.           • Decide if the word needs to be plural or not (look for words like this or these).            • Write your answer on the question paper first.            • Check you have used the right number of letters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        24","2.3.2.

They are very                 common in English.            2. The structure of a tag question is usually as follows:                                                                     Statement, auxiliary verb + subject + ?.              • If the statement is negative, the auxiliary verb in the short question is positive, and vice versa.           • Examples:                 ▪ It was a great concert, wasn’t it?                 ▪ She’s got incredible hair, hasn’t she?                 ▪ You haven’t left yet, have you?                 ▪ They won’t make a mistake, will they?                                                                                                                                                                                                  8","3.1.1.

Tom:          Did you have any problems when you moved?            Lisa:         A few. The leather sofa was too big for the living room so it’s in the dining room for now.            Tom:          What’s your new bedroom like?           Lisa:         It's bigger than my old one and I can have the computer in there now. We had it in the corner of the kitchen before.                         My parents have put the CD player in their room, but they said I could have one for my birthday!           Tom:          Great! What about that large mirror you had in the kitchen? Have you still got it?            Lisa:         Yes, and it looks really good in the new bathroom. And do you remember my mum’s books? Well, she now has           new           bookshelves in the hall – it’s much better than the books being in their bedroom! Why don’t you come and see us                         this evening?           Tom:          That’d be great.

What is another activity that I can do to practise talking about this topic?                → You can try this activity: Making a video of you going around your house and introducing the rooms as                well as the furniture inside each room. You should also describe them using learned adjectives and words                about materials.            2. What can I do to improve my listening skills after each lesson?               → You should listen again to the audios and try writing down everything that you hear from the audios. You               can read more about this method in the following link: https://flyer.vn/nghe-chep-chinh-ta-tieng-anh/.            3. What is the best way to retain vocabulary?                → In my opinion, the most effective way is to use the words/phrases in speaking and writing contexts. In                 other words, you need to put what you learn into practice.            4.

You know I like T-shirts very (47) much. Well, I found a great one yesterday. The picture (48) on the front is the Mona Lisa, but the          colours (49) are orange and green! This is now (50) my favourite T-shirt.           What clothes have you bought?

What is the difference between \"he\" and \"him\"?          •   \"He\" is a subject pronoun used when referring to a male person or animal who is the subject of a sentence or clause. Example: He is my               brother.           •   \"Him\" is an object pronoun used when the male person or animal is the object of a verb or preposition. Example: I gave the book to him.            2. What are the differences in the use of ”a”, “an” and “the”?          •    \"A\" and \"an\" are indefinite articles used before singular countable nouns that are general or non-specific. \"A\" is used before words that               begin with a consonant sound, while \"an\" is used before words that begin with a vowel sound. Example: I saw a cat in the garden.           •   \"The\" is a definite article used before singular or plural nouns when the speaker and listener are aware of the specific noun being referred               to. It indicates that the noun is known or has been mentioned before. Example: The cat that I saw in the garden was black.           3. Do prepositions have meanings?           •   Yes, prepositions have meanings. Prepositions are words that show relationships between other words in a sentence, such as location,               time,  direction,  and  manner.  They  help  provide  additional  information  about  the  relationship  between  different  elements  in  a  sentence.              Example: The book is on the table. (The preposition \"on\" indicates the relationship between the book and the table.)                                                                                                                                                                                                        25","FAQ - Frequently asked questions                   4. What is the use of \"some, a few, several\" and \"many, much, any\"?           •    \"Some\" is used to indicate an indefinite quantity of something. It is used in positive statements and is often used in affirmative sentences                when the exact quantity is unknown or unimportant. Example: I have some apples.           •    \"A few\" and \"several\" are used to indicate a small quantity or number of something, more than one but not a large amount. Example: She                has a few friends in the city. / He bought several books.           •    \"Many\" and \"much\" are used to indicate a large quantity or number of something. \"Many\" is used with countable nouns, while \"much\" is               used with uncountable nouns. Example: Many people attended the event. / She doesn't have much time.           •    \"Any\" is used to refer to an indefinite or unspecified quantity or to ask questions and make negative statements. Example: Do you have                any questions? / I don't have any money.           5. Do we often use auxiliary verbs in both statements and questions?           •    Yes, auxiliary verbs are commonly used in both statements and questions in English. They help to form verb tenses, voice, and mood. In                statements, auxiliary verbs are used to create different tenses, such as the present perfect (e.g., \"I have eaten\") or the future tense (e.g.,               \"They will come\"). In questions, auxiliary verbs are used to invert the subject and verb order. Example: Statement: She is studying for her                exam. Question: Is she studying for her exam?                                                                                                                                                                                                      26"];
